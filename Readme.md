#To do
------------
- debug code - as of now, there are at least 2 known bugs in the code - 1) The responsivity is broken, as you can see 
  when you display the html 2) After a player loses all his lives, the game is not always (if ever) correctly reset. 
- clean up the code (make sure none code is repeating, etc.)
- split the code into appropriate files
