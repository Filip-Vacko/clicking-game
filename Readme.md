#To do
------------
- debug code - as of now, there is at least one known bug in the code - After a player loses all his lives, the game 
  is not always (if ever) correctly reset. 
- clean up the code (make sure none code is repeating, delete the white spaces, etc.)
- split the code into appropriate files
- add new features
